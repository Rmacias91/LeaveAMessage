# LeaveAMessage

### What is the purpose of the app or product? What are you trying to accomplish?
Leave a Message will let users write and read messages left near their current GPS locations. This can help strangers and friends communicate through the internet but requiring physical movement and leaving the house. The messages can be helpful hints about the area, easter egg hunts, positive reinforcement, and whatever the User wants. The Application will let Users decide the limitations of these letters.
