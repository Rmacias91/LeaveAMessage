# LeaveAMessage

Leave a Message will let users write and read messages left near their current GPS locations. This can help strangers and friends communicate through the internet but requiring physical movement and leaving the house. The messages can be helpful hints about the area, easter egg hunts, positive reinforcement, and whatever the User wants. The Application will let Users decide the limitations of these letters. I'm using AWS to host the database and the application is made for the Android Operating System.
