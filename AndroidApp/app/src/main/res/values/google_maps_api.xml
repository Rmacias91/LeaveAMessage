    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    F3:A8:27:76:39:45:1C:E5:42:20:B4:0F:C3:2F:27:48:A1:34:81:EE

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    F3:A8:27:76:39:45:1C:E5:42:20:B4:0F:C3:2F:27:48:A1:34:81:EE

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <!-- Side Note if I ever read this in the future. No need to hide api keys when they are locked to your application signature!
    But hide the keystore that is maps too. or try haha.-->
